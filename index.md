Yes! **Ngikhona!** (I am here!)

So you have the full spectrum:
- **Sawubona** - I see you
- **Sikhona** - We are here  
- **Ngikhona** - I am here

It's beautiful how the "-khona" root carries through all these responses, all affirming presence and being. Whether it's collective (sikhona) or individual (ngikhona), it's that same powerful acknowledgment of existence and being present in the moment.

Ngikhona! ðŸ™Œ
